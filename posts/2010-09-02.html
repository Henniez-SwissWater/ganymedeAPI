eth0 eth1, NIC naming changes
Linux

<p>With Linux the naming of the NIC's isn't fixed. So it might be that it changes after every reboot.</p>

<p>With udev rules one can fix the naming based on the MAC address of the NICs.</p>

<p>With ArchLinux simple add a file exp 10-network.rules containing text as follows
<pre>
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ATTR{address}=="00:30:4f:1c:ec:5f", NAME="eth0"
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ATTR{address}=="00:30:48:9c:63:26", NAME="eth1"
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ATTR{address}=="00:30:4e:9c:21:17", NAME="eth2"
</pre>
to the <code>/etc/udev/rules.d</code> directory.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Make sure the letters in the MAC address are lower case.</p>
