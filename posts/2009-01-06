San Francisco
USA

<p>19:00 on thursday we arrived at san francisco international airport. Being rather tired, after a 15 hours flight from Zurich Airport to NY JFK to SFO, we took a cab to ``the green tortoise hostel''. Well, let's say there was kind of an odor in the hostels entry hall. Not all too bad but we could definitely tell that we were in an old building ;). However, the most amazing thing of the hostel way the carpet on the floor, I've never every seen such a ``colorful'' pattern. Light headed as we are, forgot to take a picture of it, therefore, you, dear reader, are encouraged to use your imagination freely. Trust me it won't be even close :P.</p>

<p>Our first day in San Francisco was paved with good fortune.  Up to now, we just knew that we wanted to see the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and ride the all-so-famous Cable Cars. Despite our plans we decided just to stroll around in the city for a while. Our good fortune took matters in its hands and lead us to the sea lions on Pier 39, which are terribly noise and smelly but very amusing :D. The fun part about it is that we had no idea about this tourist attraction. As it turned out, Pier 39 is one beautiful and entertaining place. It's kind of a tiny theme park (merry-go-arround included). As in most tourist places there are hundreds of souvenir shops but only one caught our eye; The Baba Gump Shrimps Restaurant and Souvenir Shop.  This shop sells probably all Babba Gump Related Quotes on fan articles such as mugs, shirts and so on. As you might imagine, there we also purchased our first souvenirs.</p>

<p>After the Pier 39 we decided to visit the Coit Tower (again by good luck. We saw the tower from the Pier and thought:``Hmm, we might get a good look from up there''). From there we took plenty of pictures since one has a magnificent overview over the city (pictures will be uploaded soon).</p>

<p>Then the most prominent construction of San Francisco was our next goal. The Golden Gate Bridge. I guess nothing needs to be said here. Just enjoy the pictures (coming soon).</p>

<p>After enjoying our lunch (American Hot Dogs :P) next to the bridge we went back into the city to drop by the Japanese Tea Garden in the Golden Gate Park. First we thought this might be an impressive sight because of some ads we've seen. However, this wasn't worth the bus ride. This garden is about 20 square meters big and had just patches of grass with two Japanese buildings. Yet, the Golden Gate Park isn't just the Japanese Garden. The botanic garden is also located there and was gorgeous. In the middle of this huge city there is a lagre place where you can relax. (see pics).</p>

<p>Finally, we walked back home to our hostel first through the financial district. There we could experience what a ``big city'' feels like. Tall buildings, plenty of car (actually cars were everywhere), wide streets, etc. Then we switched the street and landed in chinatown. It's amazing to see how different the city of san francisco looks at different places. this is also what makes this city in my opinion to one of the most amazing cities i've ever been to.</p>

<p>On the second day we stared by having breakfast in some local place. Then the highlight of our day. the ride with the world famous cable cars. Unfortunately, it was holiday season so there were people everywhere. Thus, we had to wait in line for approximately 45 minutes. Still, the ride was great. You get a wonderful tour through the city. In the afternoon we wanted to take the boat over to alcatraz. As it turned out, this trip is extremely popular, which we didn't know at the time. The next available date was tuesday. From the start our plan was to rent a car, if possible and reasonable in price, and explore california on our own. Thus, we decided to see alcatraz later on.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more... btw i apologize for the bad writing style but i didn't want to spend too much time on this</p>
