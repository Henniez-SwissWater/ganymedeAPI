Some things to remember when writing C++ code
Programming

<p>I recently finished reading Scott Meyers' <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1"
        target="_blank">Effective C++</a> (ec) and <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Effective-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/020163371X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"
        target="_blank">More Effective C++</a> (mec) as well as <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Coding-Standards-Rules-Guidelines-Practices/dp/0321113586/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1"
        target="_blank">C++ Coding Standards</a> (ccs) by Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu. As a side note,
    these books are a MUST READ for any C++ developer. Of course many things are common knowledge (taught at University)
    but there are plenty of very interesting concepts and pointers (literally and figuratively).</p>

<p>The post is basically a summary of things I found most useful the learn. To me this is simply summarizing task to
    remember what i read better.</p>

<strong>ec Item 6: Explicitly disallow the use of compiler generated functions you do not want</strong>

<p>This is something to achieve easily. Just declare the compiler generated functions private. This way no caller can
    access it. So when you have a class that should never be copied, declare the copy constructor and the assignment
    operator private. I good idea might be to provide a base class <a
        href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/libs/utility/utility.htm#Class_noncopyable"
        target="_blank">Uncopyable</a>.</p>

<strong>ec Item 11: Handle assignment to self in operator=</strong>

<p>An easy to follow rule but you need to have run into a bug caused by this or be told be someone of that. The item
    states that you should beware of <em>rClass</em> being the same instance as <em>*this </em>in <em>MyClass&amp;
        operator=(const MyClass&amp; rClass). </em>To avoid any problem in the case check for <em>&amp;rClass == this
    </em>as the first thing you do in the assignment operator.</p>

<strong>ec Item 12: Copy all parts of an object</strong>

<p>
    Remember to invoke the copy constructor and the assignment operators of the direct base classes of your class. This
    item
    also features a rule that I personally would have put into a separate item: "Don't try to implement one of the
    copying
    functions in terms of the other." [quote from ec] The copy constructor and the assignment operator do basically the
    same
    thing. So you might be tempted to let the copy constructor call the assignment operator or vice versa. NEVER
    DO THAT, write a private member function that is called from the two.</p>

<strong>ec Item 23: Prefer non-member non-friend functions to member functions</strong>

<strong>ec Item 32: Make sure public inheritance models "is-a"</strong>

<strong>ec Item 33: Avoid hiding inherited names</strong>

<strong>ec Item 34: Differentiate between inheritance of interface and inheritance of implementation</strong>

<strong>ec Item 35: Consider alternatives to virtual functions</strong>

<strong>ec Item 36: Never redefine an inherited non-virtual function</strong>

<strong>ec Item 37: Never redefine a function's inherited default parameter value</strong>

<strong>ec Item 38: Mode "has-a" or "is-implemented-in-terms-of" through composition</strong>

<strong>mec Item 1: Distinguish between pointer and references</strong>

<strong>mec Item 12: Understand how throwing an exception differs from passing a parameter or calling a virtual
    function</strong>

<strong>mec Item 13: Catch exceptions by reference</strong>

<strong>mec Item 19: Understand the origin of temporary objects (and C++11 rValue references)</strong>
<p>Lastly, I discovered that <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">gcc</a> provides
    a warning option that looks for items that Scott Meyers suggested. The option
    is <em>-Weffc++</em>. This helped me a lot finding bugs in assignment operators and
    copy constructors.</p>
