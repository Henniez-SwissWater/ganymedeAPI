Connect to Microsoft Exchange Server from Linux
Linux

<p>The University of Bern provides calendars, folders, address books and mail with the Microsoft Exchange solution. Since I'm an Arch-Linuxer I couldn't use Microsoft Outlook. The webinterface to the exchange server is also tiresome because without IE you only have a "light" version.</p>

<p>After some time googleing for a solution for liunx I came along novell's evolution mail. It should provide exchange capabilities but somehow I couldn't get it to work.</p>

<p>The nice little tool that solved all my problems was <a href="http://davmail.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">DavMail</a>. It is a wrapper that allows you to access all your exchange data via standard protocols.</p>

<p>For instance, you can access you calendar via the standard caldav protocol and thus you Mozilla Sunbird or Mozilla Lightning.</p>
