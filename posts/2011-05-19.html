<p><code>mscgen</code> is a simple and very handy tool to generate sequence diagrams. If you are not looking for a fancy GUI to get
    your diagram this is certainly a product to try. Furthermore, you can use msc directly in doxygen. This makes it an
    even more suitable program for c and c++ software engineers.</p>
