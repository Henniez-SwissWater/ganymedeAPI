Pointer and Non-Pointer Overloading For Template Functions
Programming

<p>Yesterday, I ran into the problem that function templates cannot be partially specialized. My goal was to distinguish
  between pointers and non-pointers.</p>

<p>So trying something like
<pre>template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo(T t) { printf("T\n"); }

// Variant 1
template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo&lt;t*&gt;(T t) { printf("T*\n"); }

// Variant 2
template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo&lt;t*&gt;(T* t) { printf("T*\n"); }
</pre>
always resulted in a compile error. To resolve this problem we can rely on the good-old function overloading mechanism.
</p>

<p>So
<pre>template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo(T t) { printf("T\n"); }

template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo(T* t) { printf("T*\n"); }
</pre>
works as expected. However now in the non-pointer case always creates a copy, which isn't desirable. Thus I experimented
with call-by-reference. Everything is straight forward when no const qualifiers are in play but the const-reference case
has a pitfall.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at this pitfall.
<pre>template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo(const T&amp; t) { printf("T&amp;\n"); }

template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo(const T*&amp; t) { printf("T*\n"); }

int main(void)
{
  int i = 0;
  int* pi = &amp;i;
  const int* cpi = &amp;i;
  foo(i);        // (a) prints T&amp;
  foo(pi);       // (b) prints T&amp;  
  foo(cpi);      // (c) prints T*
  return 0;
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>As indicated, this sample doesn't produce the expected results. The pitfall lays in the const qualifier. We need to
  remember that <code>const T*</code> is equal to <code>T const*</code>. Now let's have a look at the type
  <code>const T*&amp;</code>, which is equal to <code>T const* &amp;</code>. This is a reference to a <em>variable</em>
  pointer but the pointer points to a constant object. So we could change the address of the pointer from within the
  function (which isn't desirable). The call (b) passes a variable of type <code>int*</code> which the compiler tries to
  match to the two template functions. So the type inference for the first function is <code>T = int*</code> which
  matches. The second function on the other hand doesn't match at all because, as we saw earlier, the second function
  expects a pointer to a const object i.e. <code>const int*</code> or <code>int const*</code>. The call (c) prints T*
  because it is of this type and is as such a better match for the second function than for the first function.
  Eventually, we see that what we got is reasonable but not what we wanted.
</p>

<p>To determine what we need to write lets look again at the inferred type for call (b) and the first function. We saw
  that <code>T = int*</code>. To see what we need to write we can simply replace T with the inferred pointer type. Well,
  hang on that's what we wrote isn't it. It's <code>const T&amp;</code> =&gt; <code>const int*&amp;</code> and so we
  deduce that <code>const T*&amp;</code> should written. Yet, we saw that this isn't producing what we want. The pitfall
  is in the place of the const in the first-place. We know that <code>const T&amp;</code> is the same as
  <code>T const&amp;</code>. If we execute the same substitution as before we get <code>int* const&amp;</code> leading
  to <code>T* const&amp;</code>. When we test this we get what we want.
<pre>template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo(T const&amp; t) { printf("T&amp;\n"); }

template&lt;typename t=""&gt;
void foo(T* const&amp; t) { printf("T*\n"); }

int main(void)
{
  int i = 0;
  int* pi = &amp;i;
  foo(i);        // prints T&amp;
  foo(pi);       // prints T*
  foo(cpi);      // (c) prints T*
  return 0;
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>The problem was that I forgot to realize that the const in <code>const T&amp;</code> is "bound" to the reference.
  Well, it's a stupid mistake when you think about it but it needed some thinking :P It might be a good idea to get used
  to writing <code>T const&amp;</code> instead of <code>const T&amp;</code>.</p>
