Exim & Dovecot
Linux, Website Status

<p>I finally set up my mail server with POP3 access. I just want to host couple of mail addresses which map to users on
    the (arch-)linux system. So no fancy virtual users or LDAP. </p>

<p>First, set up exim. The configuration is straight forward. Just read through the entire configuration file. It turns
    out I needed just some adjustments. First the proper primary_homename must be set.</p>

<pre>primary_hostname = ganymede.ch</pre>

<p>Since I want to use TLS, the certificate and private key must be set. Don't generate any self-signed key. This just
    causes problems because the certificate must always be added as an exception wherever it is used. So, generate a <a
        href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Letâ€™s Encrypt</a> certificate. Point exim to Let's Encrypt files.</p>

<pre>
tls_certificate = /etc/letsencrypt/live/ganymede.ch/fullchain.pem
tls_privatekey = /etc/letsencyrpt/live/ganymede.ch/privkey.pem
</pre>

<p>The Let's Encrypt files can also be used for an Apache webserver. Apache is typically started with root privileges
    which it later drops. During this phase, the certificate and private key are read by Apache. So the default
    permission (mostly exclusively root access) of the Let's Encrypt folder works just fine for Apache. Exim on the
    other hand reads the certificate key just when a TLS connection should be established. Hence the exim log shows
    some TLS Error with a message like <em>system library:fopen:Permission denied</em>. An easy fix for this is to set
    the owner of the folder <em>/etc/letsencrypt/live/</em> and <em>/etc/letsencrypt/archive/</em> to the exim user and
    group. Clearly, this can cause problems if other users, without root privileges, need access to the files. However,
    this is not the case in my setup.</p>

<p>Next, I don't want to allow mail delivery to all local users such as the exim or http user. I just want to whitelist
    certain users. This can be achieved by modifying the <em>localuser</em> router. Simply add <code>local_parts =
        lsearch;/etc/mail/accepted_local_users</code>. So the router looks like this:</p>

<pre>
localuser:
    driver = accept
    local_parts =lsearch;/etc/mail/accepted_local_users
    check_local_user
    transport = local_delivery
    cannout_route_message = Unknown user
</pre>

<p>This router only routes if check_local_user succeeds <strong>and</strong> <em>local_parts</em> can be found in the
    <em>accepted_local_users</em> file. So, create the file <em>accepted_local_users</em> and write every username which
    is allowed to receive E-Mails into the file. One username per line.
</p>

<p>That's it... Exim with TLS done.</p>

<p>Let's look at dovecot for the POP3 access. On archlinux the dovecot configuration is split into many file. The config
    file needs to be copied into the <em>/etc</em>folder (see the <a
        href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dovecot">archlinux wiki</a>). The main config file is
    <em>/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf</em>. There it restricts the supported protocols to pop3
</p>

<pre>
protocols = pop3
</pre>

<p>This main config file loads all config files from the <em>conf.d</em> subdirectory. Here I rely on the system (PAM)
    authentication by including<em>auth-system.conf.ext</em></p>

<pre>
!include auth-system.conf.ext
</pre>

<p>Again as with exim, I want only whitelisted users to be able to login and not all system users. To achive this it is
    possible to use the <em>username_filter</em>. Simply give it the username which are allowed to login.</p>

<pre>
passdb {
    driver = pam
    username_filter = my_user my_user2
}
</pre>

<p>Of course we also want to secure the server with SSL. This is just as easy as before. Simply point dovecot to the
    Let's Encrypt certificate and private key in <em>10-ssl.conf</em></p>

<pre>
ssl_cert = &lt;/etc/letsencrypt/live/ganymede.ch/fullchain.pem
ssl_key = &lt;/etc/letsencrypt/live/ganymede.ch/privkey.pem
</pre>

<p>Since dovecot is run as root we don't have any permission issues.</p>

<p>The last thing that needs to be done, is to tell dovecot about the mailbox format and the mailbox locations. In the
    file <em>10-mail.conf </em>write</p>

<pre>
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
</pre>

<p>After that we are all done. You can receive email for the given user and access the mails through pop3 with the
    system password for that user.</p>

<p>You can also send emails from your system (for instance through mail or with php) through exim to any E-Mail address.
