Flashing the ESP-12 with Arduino UNO
Electronics

<p>
	I recently I bought a <a href="https://webduino.io/en/">Webduino-Smart</a>. It's an easily available <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP-12/ESP8266</a> chip in my country and it can be powered through
	a micro USB power supply. However, I'm not fond of the javascript based development methodology. Hence I wanted to
	move to a different firmware.
</p>

<p>
	For me the <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino">ESP8266 Arduino Core</a> was exactly what I was looking for.
	Especially, because I was already familiar with Arduino development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Webduino-Smart does not feature a USB-TTL adapter. As a consequence, the Webduino Smart cannot be
	programmed/flashed as easily as I was used to from the Arduino UNO. After doing some research I was able to misuse
	the Arduino UNO board as an USB-TTL adapter.
<p>

<p>
	So here is how I could upload my sketch from the Arduino IDE through the Arduino UNO to my Webduino-Smart.
<ol>
	<li>Remove the ATMEGA microcontroller from the Arduino UNO. The Arduino is still accessible through the device
		<em>/dev/ttyACM0</em>.</li>
	<li>Then connect the communication channels tx and rx from the Arduino to the Webduino. (TX &lt;-&gt; TX, RX
		&lt;-&gt; RX)</li>
	<li>Connect the grounds of the two boards (GND &lt;-&gt; GND).</li>
	<li>Pull the GPIO0 of the Webduino to 0 by connecting it to the ground of the Arduino (GND &lt;-&gt; 00). This puts
		the ESP-12/ESP8266 into flash mode and lets you flash a new firmware to the device.</li>
	<li>Power the Webduino with 3.3V by connecting the 3.3V ouput from the Arduino to the power input VCC of the
		Webduino (3.3V &lt;-&gt; VCC).</li>
	<li>Select the ttyACM0 connection in the Arduino IDE (Menu Tools -&gt; Port).</li>
	<li>Choose "Generic ESP8266 Module" as your board in the Arduino IDE (Menu Tools -&gt; Board). This option is only
		available if you <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.4.1/installing.html">installed the ESP8266
			Arduino Core</a>.</li>
	<li>Leave all other settings to their default values.</li>
	<li>Upload the sketch by pressing the upload button in the Arduino IDE.<br />
		<strong>Note: I had to disconnect and reconnect the power of the Webduino before uploading a sketch.</strong>
	</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>
	In order to run the sketch I simply removed the (GND &lt;-&gt; 00) connection so that the Webduino boots no longer
	into flash mode. Then reboot the Webduino by disconnecting and reconnecting the power supply.</p>

<p>
	I read somewhere that it is not necessary to remove the ATMEGA microcontroller. The entire process should also work
	with the controller in place. I never tried this since I was fine flashing to Webduino without the controller.</p>

<p>
	Disclaimer: I know that the Webduino runs on 3.3V but the TX/RX pin of the Arduino are 5V. So, there is a risk of
	frying the Webduino. It worked for me without problems though. <strong>So, just for the record, use this procedure
		at your own risk!</strong></p>
