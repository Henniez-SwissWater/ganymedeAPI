About Shared Libraries
Linux

<p>I always keep forgetting these things. So here are some facts about the shared libraries.</p>

<ul>
	<li>use the <code>ldd</code> command to see the dependencies of an executable.</li>
	<li><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> holds the paths to the directories of the shared libraries. For testing you might
		change this for an application execution like this:
		<pre>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;path to shared library&gt;:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH &lt;executable&gt;</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Most information about library handling is covered <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/"
