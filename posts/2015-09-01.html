Toggle all Charts between Logarithmic and Linear Scale
Excel

<p>I had multiple charts in one Excel Worksheet and wanted to change the scale of the x-axis and y-axis to the
	logarithmic scale. The following macro toggles between the linear and logarithmic scale for all charts:</p>
<pre>
Sub ChartsToggle()
	For i = 1 To ActiveSheet.ChartObjects.Count      
		Application.DisplayAlerts = False
		If ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(i).Chart.Axes(xlCategory).ScaleType = xlLinear Then
			ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(i).Chart.Axes(xlCategory).ScaleType = xlLogarithmic
			ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(i).Chart.Axes(xlValue).ScaleType = xlLogarithmic
		Else
			ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(i).Chart.Axes(xlCategory).ScaleType = xlLinear
			ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(i).Chart.Axes(xlValue).ScaleType = xlLinear
		End If
	Next i
	Application.DisplayAlerts = True
End Sub
</pre>

<p>Note the
	<code>Application.DisplayAlerts = False</code>.
	This prevents Excel from opening a dialog box, for every chart, informing you that negative values cannot be
	displayed.
	The dialog is just shown once at the end. I had to put this line inside the for-loop because it got changed back to
	true
	after the chart modification.
