C++ Marco Debug Options
Programming

<p>To be honest, it should be straight forward but I took me a while to figure it out.</p>

<p>I wanted to mark certain lines in the code such that I can easily enable/disable it. So here it is:
<pre>// set to 1 to enable timing and output
#if 0 
   #define TIMING 
   #define OUTPUT 
#else
   #define TIMING / ## /
   #define OUTPUT / ## /
#endif
...
   TIMING startTimer();
   ...
   TIMING stopTimer();
...
</pre>

<p>When <code>#define TIMING / ## /</code> is used then <code>TIMING</code> is replaced with <code>//</code>. Thus the entire line is commented and therefore disabled. This way i can easily turn on/off several debugging facilities.</p>

<p>The <code>##</code> in the macro definition means that the previous and successive pieces of text are concatenated. So <code>TIMING myCode;</code> results in <code>// myCode;</code>. We cannot use <code>#define TIMING //</code> because the <code>//</code> won't be parsed as the replacement string, it will be parsed as the comment literal.</p>

<p>This is a simple but handy technique.</p>
