Memory Leak Detection
Programming

<p>provides source code that allows you to monitor all memory allocation you do in a C++ program. On program termination
    it checks which memory regions have not been freed and prints it to the <code>stderr</code>. It's easy to use and
    supposedly works on different platforms (I haven't tested this yet).</p>
