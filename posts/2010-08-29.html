wxWidgets Application out of focus in Mac OS X
Programming

<p>When starting a compiled wxWidgets application in Mac OS X you may have problems getting the focus of the
    application. You can solve this problem by creating a Mac OS X bundle application and start this instead of the
    binary:</p>

<p>Make sure you configure Xcode (or whatever IDE you are using) to use the bundle or start the application manually.
