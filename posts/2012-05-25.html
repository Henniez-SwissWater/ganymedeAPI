Testing with CMake/CTest
Programming

<p>Testing in C/C++, as is widely known, doesn't have a standard Framework as Java with JUnit. A cross-plattform
  solution I've come to like is CMake/CTest (and possibly CDash).</p>

<p>With CMake we can build tests than can be executed with CTest and the results can be published to CDash if needed.
  CMake has the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:add_test"
    target="_blank"><code>add_test(...)</code></a> function which lets you define a new test by give the name of the
  test that is
  displayed and the executable with optional arguments. Basically, a test is successful when the executable returns 0
  and false otherwise. Since we must give an executable to be run we can either build hundreds of executables, one for
  each test. But this isn't very efficient when we have to link a large library. So usually, we build multiple tests in
  one executable and distinguish which test to run by an argument to the executable. Normally such test
  applications are called TestDriver or TestRunner.</p>

<p>CMake provides a function that builds a TestDriver for you. With <a
    href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:create_test_sourcelist"
    target="_blank"><code>create_test_sourcelist(...)</code></a> you can pass it all the source files that define some
  tests. By
  convention it is assumed that a test source file call <code>Test1.cpp</code> has a function
  <code>int Test1(int, char*[])</code>. The CMake function gives us a list of all files that we need for compiling the
  TestDriver.
</p>

<p>With this list we can build the TestDriver with <a
    href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:add_executable"
    target="_blank"><code>add_executable(...)</code></a>. We add here any other files that are needed and then also link
  all libs we
  need for the tests with <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:target_link_libraries"
    target="_blank"><code>target_link_libraries(...)</code></a>.</p>

<p>The last thing we need is to tell CMake about the test in the TestDriver with<a
    href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:add_test"
    target="_blank"><code>add_test(...)</code></a>. I
  wonder why they don't provide a function that also adds the test automatically. But for now we have to call <a
    href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:add_test"
    target="_blank"><code>add_test(...)</code></a>
  for each test we have.</p>

<p>Putting everything together with some helper macro we have a system which is easy to extend and use for testing.
<pre>macro(add_test_case name)
  set(test_src_list "${test_src_list}" "${name}.cpp")
  add_test(NAME ${test_driver}.${name} COMMAND ${test_driver} ${name})
endmacro()

set(test_driver "MyTestDriver")

add_test_case(Case1)
add_test_case(Case2)

create_test_sourcelist(testDriverSrcList "${test_driver}.cpp" ${test_src_list})
add_executable(${test_driver} ${testDriverSrcList} "Source1.cpp" "Source2.cpp")
target_link_libraries(${test_driver} Lib1 Lib2)</pre>
