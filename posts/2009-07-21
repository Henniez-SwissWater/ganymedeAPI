CUDA and Critical Sections with Locks
OpenGL

<p>I had the following problem:</p>

<blockquote>Each CUDA Thread might possible write to any cell in a 3d array in global memory. Thus, some synchronization is required.</blockquote>

<p>The easiest solution is using the atomic operations which are provided by CUDA. Unfortunately, the performance isn't great. Therefore, I tried improving the performance by implementing a locking mechanism of my own. Simply, using a lock.</p>

<p>The result was that this approach is absolutely useless. I experienced a performance loss of nearly 1000x</p>
