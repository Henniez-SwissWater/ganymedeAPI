ffmpeg stream interleaving
Programming

<p>There are plenty of complaints about the ffmpeg API being badly documented and hard to learn. While this was the case
    some years ago, ffmpeg has come along way and is very well documented. However, there are still some parts where
    prior knowledge is required and thus looks not well documented. For me, this was the case with writing video files.
</p>

<p>First let's look at what we need to do to write a video:
<ol>
    <li>find your frame you want to add to the video.</li>
    <li>bring it into a form the encoder can work with (I use here the <code>sws_scale</code> which converts my RGBA to
        a YUV420p or whatevery the encoder likes)</li>
    <li>encode this sws_scaled frame with <code>avcodec_encode_video2</code>. This gives us an <code>AVPacket</code>
        when the frame was encoded. It can also be buffered, in which case no valid <code>AVPacket</code> is returned.
        When you want to finish your video and your last frame was buffered then you need to flush the encoder to give
        you
        all the buffered images.</li>
    <li>when a valid <code>AVPacket</code> is returned then it needs to be written to the video file. This is done by
        either <code>av_write_packet</code> or <code>av_interleaved_write_packet</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In step 4 I was not sure what to choose. What does interleaved mean? What are the consequences of using the wrong
    function?</p>

<p>So, here is what I figured you.</p>

<p>Interleaving means the interleaving of the individual streams in a video file. A video, normally, has one video
    and one audio stream. For a video player to efficiently play the audio and video frames for a certain point in
    time the data should be close by (in a memory sense). Otherwise, the player has to hunt and seek the matching
    pairs of audio and video frames over the entire video file. This of course would kill the real-time aspect of
    any video. So to provide a sensible video we must interleave the audio and video frames. When we look at how
    ffmpeg interleaves a simple matroska example we see that the packets in the video file are first ordered by
    timestamp and then by stream index. Of course when the video has not only I Frames this timestamp ordering is
    not given.</p>

<p>I still need to figure out the rule for interleaving the P Frames properly.</p>

<p>So back to the question what the consequences are of using the wrong function. <code>av_write_packet</code>
    expects the programmer to pass the packets in the interleaved order. As we can see, this can be difficult when P
    Frames and B Frames come into play. On the other hand, <code>av_interleaved_write_packet</code> buffers the
    packets internally and reorders then such that they meet the "interleaved criteria". So, in case of doubt about
    how the correctly interleave (which I obviously still am) use the <code>av_interleaved_write_packet</code>. This
    guarantees you the right interleaving. On the downside it requires more memory due to the internal buffering.
    This buffering can be enormous when the packets are passed to <code>av_interleaved_write_packet</code> in a
    suboptimal way. For instance, writing first all frames from stream one the all frames from stream two is bad
    because the first stream needs to be buffered entirely.</p>

<p>To sum up, as I still do not know how to interleave P and B Frames properly I will use the
    <code>av_interleaved_write_packet</code> to write video files. When not one entire stream after the other is
    written (all packets of stream one then all packets of stream two and so on) the performance is acceptable and
    the memory consumption moderate.
