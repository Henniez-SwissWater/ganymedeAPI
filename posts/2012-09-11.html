INT*_C Macros
Programming

<p>The header <code>stdint.h</code> defines loads of macros. As such it is an omnipresent header that is included in
   many other headers. Being a C99 header, some macros are disabled in C++. One example are the
   <code>INT8_C, INT16_C, INT32_c and INT64_C</code> macros. When looking at the header (see below) one sees that the
   macros can be enabled in C++ by defining <code>__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS</code>.
<pre>/* The ISO C99 standard specifies that in C++ implementations these
   should only be defined if explicitly requested.  */
#if !defined __cplusplus || defined __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS

/* Signed.  */
# define INT8_C(c)      c
# define INT16_C(c)     c
# define INT32_C(c)     c
# if __WORDSIZE == 64
#  define INT64_C(c)    c ## L
# else
#  define INT64_C(c)    c ## LL
# endif

...
#endif
</pre>
</p>

<p>When I tried this in some C++ file in my project, it didn't fix the
   <code>error: UINT64_C was not declared in this scope</code>. I realized that the header has already been included
   before I defined <code>__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS</code>. Due to the header guard the define has no effect. To fix this
   problem I simply undef the header guard.
<pre>#define __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS
#ifdef _STDINT_H
# undef _STDINT_H
#endif
# include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>Of course this trick does not work for all header but in the case of <code>stdint.h</code> it works because this
   header only defines macros.</p>
