GLSL Samplers
OpenGL

<p>I just tried to find a bug in my texturing shader. Unforunately, I forgot to set the filtering parameters. As a
    result, the sampler in the shader always returned 0.</p>

<p>Hopefully I learnt my lesson</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong>: <em>Always set the filtering parameters for textures if you want to do texturing!!!!!</em>
