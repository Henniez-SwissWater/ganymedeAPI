Bash Loop Over Folder Contents
Linux

<p>I was writing a bash script which has to loop over several folder recently. The command</p>

<pre>for i in $( ls ); do ...</pre>

<p>does that. However, if the folder or file names  contain whitespaces then this wont work because the <code>for</code> loop splits the input at whitespaces. the reason for this is because <code>for</code> loop uses whatever is in the $IFS environment variable and uses that as the splitter characters. By default it is set to the space character. Thus we have to change this temporarily to a line break.</p>

<pre>
SAVEIFS=$IFS
IFS=$(echo -en "\n\b")
....
IFS=$SAVEIFS</pre>
