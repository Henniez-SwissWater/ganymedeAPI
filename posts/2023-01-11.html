Portable VS Code with Python - kind of
Programming

<p>I wanted to create a portable VS Code with Python and git integrated for Windows. As it turns out each component has a portable versions.</p>
<p>Git provides a portable Windows build (<a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">see here</a>). So no problemo at this front.</p>
<p>As for Python, there exists a "<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Windows embeddable package</a>". This is simply a barebone version of python. Specifically, <code>pip</code> is not included.
