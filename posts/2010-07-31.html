To Florida
USA

<p>After the short visit to New Orleans (2 days seems enough to see all the sights), we picked up our rental at the New
    Orleans International Airport. The employees were a bit startled when they realized that we want to drive to Orlando
    Florida in the smallest available car. Well for Swiss measures this car isn't that small but compared to the
    standard US car it definitely is.</p>

<p>We began our 1000 mile trip south towards Key West. First we drove east along the gulf coast, which is absolutely
    lovely.</p>

<p>On the first day we drove from New Orleans to a town call Mobile (supposedly pronounced mo-bee-l). The reason why we
    ended up in Mobile was that while driving along to coast we came along a huge NAVY ship. As it turns out this was
    the USS Alabama which is now a museum.</p>

<p>The museum features the obviously the battleship USS Alabama where all decks as open to the public (unlike the USS
    Intrepid in New York). Furthermore, the submarine USS Drum and many aircrafts (F14, F15, F/A 18 and many more) can
    be inspected. Overall, the exhibition is amazing and is definitely worth spending 15.-</p>

<p>After the spontaneous visit to the museum we headed south towards St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg in Florida is the
    <em>twin city</em> of Tampa, which some might know from the NHL team Tampa Bay Lighting. In St. Petersburg we payed
    the
    Dali museum a visit. We joined a guided tour that covered the artistic development of Dali. Plenty of information
    about Dali and his work was given and made the exhibition a remarkable place to visit.
</p>

<p>After the Dali museum we continued driving south to find a nice place to spend the night. We came along a town called
    Siesta Keys. Siesta Keys is a beautiful little island with an awesome beach where breathtaking sunsets can be
    experienced. We ended up enjoying one of these lovely sunsets and also delicious dinner the a local restaurant.</p>
