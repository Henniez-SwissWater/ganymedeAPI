Http Git Server
Programming, Linux

<p>Eventually, I decided to give GIT a try. Therefore, I set up a GIT server on ganymede.ch. The server uses the handy
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-http-backend.html">git-http-backend</a></p>

<p>The git-http-backend is basically a cgi script that processes git requests. The set up is straight forward. First you
    have to make sure that apache can access and execute the git scripts. On Arch Linux this look like this:

<pre>
directory "="" usr="" lib="" git-core*"=""&gt;
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
&lt;/directory&gt;
</pre>

To get the cgi script working I followed the manpage and added

<pre>SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /srv/git
SetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL
SetEnv REMOTE_USER=$REDIRECT_REMOTE_USER
ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend/
</pre>

Finally, we want some authentication and this can be done by

<pre>
&lt;location git="" reposname=""&gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Private Git Access"
    Require group committers
    ...
&lt;/location&gt;
</pre>

for read/write authentication or

<pre>
&lt;locationmatch "^="" git="" reposname="" git-receive-pack$"=""&gt;
      AuthType Digest
      AuthName "Git Repositories"
      AuthUserFile /srv/git/.git-auth-file
      AuthGroupFile /srv/git/.git-group-file
      Require group mygroup
&lt;/locationmatch&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>I have an entry for each separate repository. This way I can have a fine grained access scheme by using different
    groups for different repositories.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to ScriptAlias / instead of /git to the CGI script.
    For more information see: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7222992/git-http-backend">stackoverflow</a>
</p>

<p>This gives an already working GIT server. I installed also cgit to provide a webinterface.</p>

<p>What remains to be done is to create a repository. For this we execute <code>git --bare init reposname</code>. Make sure
    apache has all the necessary rights for this newly created repository.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you experience error messages during clone that mention something about
    <code>update-server-info</code> then you should execute <code>git update-server-info</code> in your repository and then
    enable the post-update hook containing <code>exec git update-server-info</code> (In my case this was the default in the
    post-update file). Btw: the hooks are located under <em>hooks</em> in the repository folder. Another issue is that
    right after <code>git --bare init</code> there is nothing in the repository. So, I had to do an explicit <em>push</em>
    the first time. This means I specified where I want to <em>push</em> (<code>git push http://my_git_server/git/repos
        master</code>).</p>

<p>On the client side it might be worth using <code>~/.netrc</code> file with
<pre>
machine git_server.com
login your_git_login
password your_git_password
</pre>
This way you don't have to pass the password everytime you push/pull to/from the GIT server.</p>
