ArchLinuxARM Package Downgrading
Linux

<p>I'm running <a href="https://www.archlinuxarm.org">ArchLinuxARM</a> on my <a
        href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/odroid-c2">Odroid C2</a>. After a system upgrade it
    wouldn't boot anymore. So after going through some forums I figured out that systemd was the culprit. I had to
    downgrade to the previous version. However how do I achieve this when I have just x64 systems laying around.</p>

</p>My goal was to take the MMC which stores the system of my Odroid C2 and mount it on my x64 so that a have access to
the filesystem of the ArchLinuxARM installation. This is pretty straightforward with a memorycard adapter. Now comes the
tricky part.</p>

<p>You need to be able to run arm executables (im my case aarch64). So the first step is to get
    <code>qemu-user-static</code> onto my x64 system. <a
        href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qemu-user-static">AUR</a> has a package for this. After
    having built and installed this package, copy the executable for your architecture to the mounted MMC. I mounted it
    to <em>/mnt</em>
</p>

<pre>cp /usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static /mnt/usr/bin/</pre>

<p>Next you need the <a
        href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/arch-install-scripts/">arch-install-scripts</a> to get the
    <code>arch-chroot</code> command. This is a modified <code>chroot</code> command which sets up all ArchLinux
    specific configurations.
</p>

<p>Now we execute <code>pacman</code> to downgrade the package on the mounted mmc.</p>

<pre>arch-chroot /mnt qemu-aarch64-static /bin/pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/systemd-244.3-1-aarch64.pkg.tar.xz</pre>
