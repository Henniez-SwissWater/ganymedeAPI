Detach a command from a terminal
Linux

<p>When you run an application from a terminal and you close the terminal then the application terminates. This is also the case when you run the application in the background (<code>&amp;</code> at the end). To detach a application entirely from a terminal and therefore daemonized it, we can use the <code>nohup</code> command.</p>

<pre>nohup cmd &amp;</pre>
