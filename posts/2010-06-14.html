OpenCV Mat and its Data Types
Programming

<p>Since, OpenCV's documentation is more than lacking a few sentences I'll post some important facts that can easily be
    missed.</p>

<p>To access the elements of a <code>cv::Mat</code> one can use the <code>at&lt;T&gt;(int y, int x)</code> method.
    Usually, the elements are stored as doubles (<code>CV_64F</code>). So to get for example elements (1,1) the call is
</p>

<pre>mat.at&lt;double&gt;(1,1);</pre>

<p>but you're not forbidden to call</p>

<pre>mat.at&lt;float&gt;(1,1);</pre>

<p>OpenCV won't complain that you're reading the wrong data type. OpenCV also doesn't perform a type conversion. Hence,
    you'll end up with the wrong data.</p>

<p>In summary, make sure you're reading the correct data type. You might use the <code>depth()</code> method to figure
    out the internal type of the matrix</p>
