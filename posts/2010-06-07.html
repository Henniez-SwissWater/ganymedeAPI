TWM Initial Window Placement
Linux

<p>TWM is a rather simplistic window manager that is suitable for managing the windows of a media center. However one
    annoying thing is that you have to give it the initial placement of new windows. To avoid this use the following
    option:</p>

<pre>echo RandomPlacement &gt;&gt; ~/.twmrc</pre>

<p>and to get rid of the window titles use</p>

<pre>echo NoTitle &gt;&gt; ~/.twmrc</pre>
